# PheroTask - Virtual Pheromone Task Allocation System
This framework is an adaptation of the PheroCom work [1] to operate on a constrained physical system with communication restraints of 28 bytes per message. 

The physical system is based on the work by [2] using an M5 Stack Core2 as the master controller alongside an IR communication board and Pololu 3pi+ slave subsystems.
